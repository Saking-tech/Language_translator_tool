# Language Translator Tool

## Overview

Welcome to the **Language Translator Tool**! This project provides a powerful and versatile solution for translating speech from one language to another, with audio output. The tool offers two distinct translation methods: one leveraging the OpenAI API and the other utilizing Google Translator. Designed with flexibility and user convenience in mind, this tool is perfect for real-time communication in different languages.

## Key Features

1. **Speech Input and Audio Output**: The tool allows users to input their speech in one language and receive the translation in another language as audio. This ensures a seamless and natural communication experience.
   
2. **Dynamic Language Selection**: Upon starting the tool, users are prompted to select the language they will speak in, followed by the language they wish to communicate in. This two-step language selection process ensures accurate and context-aware translations.

3. **Adaptive Voice Modulation**: The tool dynamically changes the voices based on the languages chosen by the user. This feature enhances the realism and clarity of the translated speech, providing an immersive user experience.

## Translation Methods

1. **OpenAI API**: The first method uses the OpenAI API for translation. This method harnesses the power of advanced machine learning models to provide high-quality translations, especially for complex sentences and idiomatic expressions. 

2. **Google Translator**: The second method integrates with Google Translator, offering a reliable and widely recognized translation service. This method is particularly useful for translating common phrases and everyday language.

## Installation

To get started with the Language Translator Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-translator-tool.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd language-translator-tool
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up your API keys:
   - **OpenAI API**: Obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) and add it to the configuration file.
   - **Google Translator**: Ensure that Google Translate is accessible in your environment.

5. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python translator_tool.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Select Input Language**: When prompted, choose the language you will speak in from the available options.
2. **Select Output Language**: Next, select the language you want to translate your speech into.
3. **Speak**: Begin speaking in the selected input language. The tool will process your speech and provide the translation in the output language as audio.
4. **Listen**: The translated audio will be played back to you in the chosen output language, with the voice dynamically adjusted to match the selected language.

## Future Enhancements

We are continuously working to improve the Language Translator Tool. Future updates may include:
- Support for additional languages.
- Integration with more translation APIs.
- Improved voice modulation for better speech recognition and output quality.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
